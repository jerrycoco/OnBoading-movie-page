SwiftUI-based Onboarding Screen for a Movie Streaming App
This project is an implementation of an onboarding screen for a hypothetical movie streaming app. The screen displays various elements such as an image of the Joker character, a main title, a "Get Started" button, and more.

The project was created using Apple's SwiftUI framework and uses various built-in views and modifiers to achieve a visually appealing design with smooth animations and vibrant colors.

Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own SwiftUI-based projects!
